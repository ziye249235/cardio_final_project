SELECTED TOPIC: Cardiovascular Disease

REASON OF SELCTION: We found this dataset to be very interesting and relevant to the world. As Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, it would be beneficial to have an algorithm for its early detection.

SOURCE OF DATA: This data is extracted from Kaggle.com, which is an online community of Data Scientists and Maching Learning practitioners.

QUESTIONS WE HOPE TO BE ANSWERED: We are hoping that after working with this database, we will be able to detect the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease early depending on variables such as patient's age, gender, physical activity and more.
