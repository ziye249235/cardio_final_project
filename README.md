## Presentation
SELECTED TOPIC: Cardiovascular Disease

REASON OF SELCTION: We found this dataset to be very interesting and relevant to the world. As Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, it would be beneficial to have an algorithm for its early detection.

SOURCE OF DATA: This data is extracted from Kaggle.com, which is an online community of Data Scientists and Maching Learning practitioners.

QUESTIONS WE HOPE TO BE ANSWERED: We are hoping that after working with this database, we will be able to detect the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease early depending on variables such as patient's age, gender, physical activity and more.

## GitHub:
### Description of the communication protocols: 
In order to transmit and exchange information smoothly and error-free, each team member created their own github branch in the final project github page to upload their work seperately and merge work together as a team work. This communication protocols gives team member access to detect transmission errors and prevent data loss. 

Besides github, team member are using video conferencing tool like Zoom to set up meeting during weekend and communication tool like Slack to share thoughts and insights. Team hosted two meeting during the week. In the first meeting, team decided the big picture for this project, including the choice of topic, source of data and choice of model. In the second meeting, team came to a common agreement on each individual's role on this project and responsibility on specific part of assignment.
